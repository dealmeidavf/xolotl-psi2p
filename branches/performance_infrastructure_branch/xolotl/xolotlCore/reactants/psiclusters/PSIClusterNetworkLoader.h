/**
 * This class will load a reaction network composed of PSIClusters from an
 * inputstream.
 *
 * The data in the stream should contain the information for a single cluster on
 * each line with the following quantities specified and separated by a single
 * space each:
 * > The number of He in the cluster
 * > The number of V in the cluster
 * > The number of I in the cluster
 * > The He binding energy
 * > The V binding energy
 * > The I binding energy
 * > The trap mutation binding energy
 *
 * Where appropriate, any binding energy may be specified as "Infinity" to
 * signify that the cluster does not undergo that type of dissociation.
 *
 * Lines of comments starting with a "#" will be ignored as will lines that do
 * not clearly provide the information above.
 *
 * The network will be returned as a ReactionNetwork of PSIClusters ordered with
 * single-species He, V and I clusters first and all mixed clusters coming
 * last. Each species is ordered from the smallest cluster size, (1), to the
 * maximum size for that cluster. Instances of the appropriate cluster type are
 * instantiated during the loading process, but returned as PSIClusters.
 *
 * The ReactionNetwork's map of properties will contains the following
 * information about the network with the following keys:
 * > maxHeClusterSize - The number of He atoms in the largest single-species
 *  He cluster.
 * > maxVClusterSize - The number of atomic vacancies in the largest
 * single-species V cluster.
 * > maxIClusterSize - The number of interstitials in the largest
 * single-species I cluster.
 * > maxMixedClusterSize - The number of species of all types in the largest
 * mixed species in the network. It is equal to the sum of the max single
 * species helium and vacancy cluster sizes by default.
 * > numHeClusters - The number of single-species He clusters of all sizes in
 * the network.
 * > numVClusters - The number of single-species V clusters of all sizes in the
 * network.
 * > numIClusters - The number of single-species I clusters of all sizes in the
 * network.
 * > numMixedClusters - The number of mixed-species clusters of all sizes in the
 * network.
